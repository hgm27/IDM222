### About Me

My name is Hima Mistry and I am a senior at Drexel University studying Business Administration with a double major in Finance and Business Analytics and minor in Interactive Digital Media. I chose to pursue a major in finance because I liked the idea that the decisions that were made in finance were dependent on the events that were happening around the world. Living in a technology driven society, I wanted to have exposure to innovation, which starts with the analysis of raw data. My curiosity led me to my double major in business analytics. However, a part of me always wanted to pursue my creative side during undergrad and minoring in interactive digital media fulfilled that desire. 

Over the course of my four years at Drexel, I was able to receive professional experiences in three different industries. My latest professional experience was at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in New York City. I was able to dive into investments in equity through a multitude of projects. I have developed critical thinking and problem solving skills by conducting analyses on stock attribution and portfolio construction. I gained advanced skills in Excel, in addition to the ability to think analytically by calculating annualized returns, information ratio, and upside/downside capture for value equity portfolios. At Grant Thornton, my second experience, I I was able to establish rapport with all levels of clients through multifaceted projects with seven different teams, develop financial valuations, and conduct fundamental market research. I conducted net present value  (NPV) calculations and analyzing financial statements resulting in $800K in cost savings. Lastly, at Chubb, an insurance firm, I was a international finance co-op where I prepared various financial statements, conducted monthly summaries and conversions. 

At Drexel, I am involved in Alpha Kappa Psi, a co-ed professional business fraternity, Delta Phi Epsilon, an international sorority and Dean's Student Advisory Board (DSAB) In Alpha Kappa Psi, I held two positions: Chapter Relations Chair and Rush Chair. As chapter relations chair, I coordinated with other chapters around the country to coordinate a joint professional event. As rush chair, I was in charge of planning five days of events for prospective members and overseeing a committee of 10 people. In Delta Phi Epsilon, I served as the Vice President of Finance and was accountable for the budget of the organization. As a board member for DSAB, I have acted as a liaison for the students and the Dean to implement improvements to the school. 

In terms of my career aspirations, I want to be working in client facing role that incorporates my technical skills and creative skills. I hope to work at Google as the Partner Marketing Lead for Google Cloud. I would be able to shape the future of Chrome and Google enterprise services around the world, defining the global marketing strategy to bring the magic of Google to consumers. I would be using both my quantitative and qualitative skills along with creative judgment to develop strategies for stakeholders.
